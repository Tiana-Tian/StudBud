# Website Design Refinment

Based on self-refection and general feedback from peers and tutor, few suggestions bebfore creating the prototype.

## Feedback:
1. sdfsdf
2. sdfsdf
3. asdfadf

## Iteration 1



# Development Highlight

## Developing responsive website
#### Relative links:


## Single CSS vs multiple CSS files
Single css or multiple specific css consideration
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2336302/single-huge-css-file-vs-multiple-smaller-specific-css-files

## Button/Link Feedback
Another worth mentioning point during the prototype is to add dynamic changes to button or link when users interact with their cursor. 


# Reflection and Limitation

One valuable lesson learned is the necessity of ongoing ideate and iteration throughout the entire design process. Everytime I make a loop back to "ideation" again, my idea gets more concrete. And more importanty to consistantly commit any modular changes to my code so I could have a clear track of the developments and progress overall.

However, within the limited timeframe, I was unable to create the floating pop-up pages for both timer and music player. They have been included as seperate pages within the web app through nav tab.


A lof of the ideas and codes were inspired from existing project management tools and themes example and modified to fit into my proposal website app design, as in future learning, I hope I could have more original ideas.
